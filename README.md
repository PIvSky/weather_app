# Weather app project

### Description


This is my 3rd project which is part of **Modern JS Course by NetNinja.** 
Weather APP is concentrated on API and Async JS and is written in **Vanilla JavaScript.**

## Developer environment

To run this descopt application I can recommend:
- VS Code

Extentions you should have to run my app in browser is:
- Live Server

##### To run Live Server
you must search and install it in VS Code extensions too.

Next, you should click RMB in your index.html file, and choose 'Open with Live Server'. Webpage will run in your browser like a local host.

## API Key
My free API key in AccuWeather is limited to 20 requests. I hope my key is still running and you can check my Weather App. If not, please send me a message.

#### *I realize that the visible API is a 'security incident' and should not be in my repository. However, I decided to leave it here as it does not contain sensitive data or access to it.*
